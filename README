This toolbox provides code for running Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior
inference for a variety of topic models, including latent dirichlet allocation (LDA)
and *supervised* latent dirichlet allocation (sLDA).    

The repository is organized as follows:  
  code/ contains relevant Matlab code. This should be the working dir in Matlab.
        within code/, you can find a fast intro script in code/demo/EasyDemo.m
  doc/  contains human-readable documentation.
        QuickStartGuide.pdf in particular describes how to configure the code.
  data/ contains one example dataset
        See the demos for how to run posterior inference on this data.
